# NFCWCHSAO B4
# Beeping Blinking Badge Buddy

This board has an engergy harvesting NFC EEPROM and WCH CH32V003 MCU.  
The MCU is connected to an RGB LED and piezo buzzer.
The two ICs are 8 pin SOIC, and the passives are 0603 so it is not too dificult to hand assemble, except for the RGB LED that is a little fine pitch, but the pads are extended and the close pins are shorted together anyway so it is not too difficult.

This board is designed for and looks great in OSH Park After Dark
